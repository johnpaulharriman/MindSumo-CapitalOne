The Therapod species, dating from the late Jurassic (155m years ago) is scientifically very interesting. It’s an unknown predator which, argues the Society of Vertebrate Palaeontologists, is why it should not be owned by the highest bidder, but made available to palaeontologists for more scientific study.\n\n\n\nCategory 6 Hurricanes \n\nThe 1st of June marks the start of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Leading climate scientists debate whether we will see fewer or more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. There is a mounting consensus, however, that we will see more intense hurricanes. So do we need to add a more severe Category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale.\n\n\n\nListening to Ice Melt \n\nIf you listen carefully to ice sheets in the Arctic, you can hear the glaciers calving and even the bubbles bursting as the ice melts. Scientists are attempting to calibrate these sounds with the extent of ice-melt in order to remotely monitor the state of the polar ice.\n\n\n\nBacterial Lending Library\n\nMore than 3000 medically relevant bacteria, including some of those responsible for the deadliest diseases (plague, dysentery and cholera) have had their genomes decoded. This brings the 100 year old national collection bang up to date. The collection is an invaluable resource for researchers wanting to understand how bacterial antibiotic resistance evolved over time and to help make detection of disease outbreaks now more accurate.\n\n\n\nPicture: A dinosaur skeleton, sold to a private buyer at an auction in Paris for €1.6m (£1.4m; $2m), Credit: AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\nPresenter: Roland Pease\n\nProducer: Fiona Roberts","content_types":["audio"],"description":"This week an auction of a 70% complete dinosaur ske…ntists have captured the biggest explosions in the Universe in unprecedented detail for the first time.

But in this short, we find out that Beethoven might have made a last-ditch effort to keep his music from ever feeling familiar, to keep pushing his listeners to a kind of psychological limit.</p> <p>Jad starts out talking with <strong>Alan Pierson</strong>, Artistic Director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, about the fact that neither of them really like Beethoven's Fifth. It feels, they say, heavy and ponderous. But then Alan tells Jad a story: Late in life, Beethoven got his hands on a metronome, went back into his symphonies, and marked them with tempos that are shockingly fast -- so fast, in fact, that most conductors simply refuse to play them as marked. To investigate, we gather up a quartet of musicians to give us a feel for Beethoven's speedy beats, and we talk to composer and author <strong>Matthew Guerrieri</strong> about the way fast tempos push us and unsettle us. But is that really what Beethoven was going for? WQXR host <strong>Terrance McKnight</strong> says given his background and personality, Beethoven clearly didn't want his music to be easy and comfortable. So, as an homage to our new found vision of Ludwig van B., we ask Alan and his players to take the Fifth to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to our <a href=\"http://www.bphil.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Philharmonic </a>musicians: Deborah Buck and Suzy Perelman on violin, Arash Amini on cello, and Ah Ling Neu on viola.</p>\n<p>And check out <span class=\"book\"><a title=\"buy this book at Amazon\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307593282/radiolabbooks-20/\"><em>The First Four Notes</em></a></span>, Matthew Guerrieri's book on Beethoven's Fifth.</p>","duration":null,"files":[{"filesize":0,"mimetype":"audio/mpeg","urls":["https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/http://audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13beethoven.mp3"]}],"flattr":null,"guid":"http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/feb/19/speedy-beet/","language":null,"license":null,"link":"http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/269783-speedy-beet/","number":null,"released":1361311200,"short_title":null,"subtitle":"There are few musical moments more well-worn than the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

But conditions at the home were appalling. Designed for 400, it was home to hundreds more boys and girls. And far from being a sanctuary for the children, there was a terrifying culture of abuse – sexual and physical. On 7th March, 2017 more than 100 of the children and young people broke out. Most were rounded up in the local area by the police. As punishment, they were locked up. And in protest, in the room where the girls were corralled, one of them set fire to a mattress.\n\n\n\nAssignment meets families, explores the fate of others who lived at the home, and talks to welfare workers. Why did no one heed the loud warning bells about Virgen de la Asuncion?\n\n\n\nPresenter Linda Pressly\n\nProducer Georgina Hewes\n\n\n\nPhoto title: Heidi Hernandez – her daughter survived the fire with life-changing injuries / Credit: Georgina Hewes BBC","duration":1588,"files":[{"filesize":12704000,"mimetype":"audio/mpeg","urls":["http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-low/proto/http/vpid/p06b1myv.mp3"]}],"flattr":null,"guid":"urn:bbc:podcast:p06b1rj1","language":null,"license":null,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06b1rj1","number":null,"released":1528980300,"short_title":null,"subtitle":"Why did no one heed the loud warning bells about Virgen de la Asuncion?","title":"Guatemala – After the Fire"},{"author":"BBC World Service","content":"Peter White, who was born without sight, tours the world, navigating primarily with his ears.

The Therapod species, dating from the late Jurassic (155m years ago) is scientifically very interesting. It’s an unknown predator which, argues the Society of Vertebrate Palaeontologists, is why it should not be owned by the highest bidder, but made available to palaeontologists for more scientific study.\n\n\n\nCategory 6 Hurricanes \n\nThe 1st of June marks the start of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Leading climate scientists debate whether we will see fewer or more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. There is a mounting consensus, however, that we will see more intense hurricanes. So do we need to add a more severe Category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale.\n\n\n\nListening to Ice Melt \n\nIf you listen carefully to ice sheets in the Arctic, you can hear the glaciers calving and even the bubbles bursting as the ice melts. Scientists are attempting to calibrate these sounds with the extent of ice-melt in order to remotely monitor the state of the polar ice.\n\n\n\nBacterial Lending Library\n\nMore than 3000 medically relevant bacteria, including some of those responsible for the deadliest diseases (plague, dysentery and cholera) have had their genomes decoded.

But in this short, we find out that Beethoven might have made a last-ditch effort to keep his music from ever feeling familiar, to keep pushing his listeners to a kind of psychological limit.</p> <p>Jad starts out talking with <strong>Alan Pierson</strong>, Artistic Director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, about the fact that neither of them really like Beethoven's Fifth. It feels, they say, heavy and ponderous. But then Alan tells Jad a story: Late in life, Beethoven got his hands on a metronome, went back into his symphonies, and marked them with tempos that are shockingly fast -- so fast, in fact, that most conductors simply refuse to play them as marked. To investigate, we gather up a quartet of musicians to give us a feel for Beethoven's speedy beats, and we talk to composer and author <strong>Matthew Guerrieri</strong> about the way fast tempos push us and unsettle us. But is that really what Beethoven was going for? WQXR host <strong>Terrance McKnight</strong> says given his background and personality, Beethoven clearly didn't want his music to be easy and comfortable.

Yet her vision of social reform, involving volunteers and private enterprise rather than central government, was often at odds with that of her contemporaries.With:Dinah BirchProfessor of English Literature and Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research at Liverpool UniversityLawrence GoldmanFellow in Modern History at St Peter's College, OxfordGillian DarleyHistorian and biographer of Octavia HillProducer: Thomas Morris.","duration":2543,"files":[{"filesize":40688000,"mimetype":"audio/mpeg","urls":["http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download/proto/http/vpid/p02q5d59.mp3"]}],"flattr":null,"guid":"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/ioth/ioth_20110407-1030.mp3","language":null,"license":null,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100jpz","number":null,"released":1302168600,"short_title":null,"subtitle":"Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Victorian social reformer Octavia Hill.","title":"Octavia Hill"}],"errors":{},"flattr":null,"http_etag":"\"900bfc2015ff2d461631447b01fe496e\"","http_last_modified":"Sun, 17 Jun 2018 07:53:52 GMT","hub":null,"language":"en","license":null,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl","logo":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/3000x3000/p03xq2kz.jpg","new_location":null,"subtitle":"Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the history of ideas","tags":["Society & Culture","History"],"title":"In Our Time","urls":["http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/iot/rss.xml"],"warnings":{}}}"httpdownloadsbbccoukpodcastsworldservicedocarchiverssxml: "{"url":"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/docarchive/rss.xml","info":{"author":"BBC","common_title":null,"content_types":["audio"],"description":"Download the latest documentaries Investigating global developments, issues and affairs.","episodes":[{"author":"BBC World Service","content":"What does the way you handle your finances say about your relationship?","content_types":["audio"],"description":"What does the way you handle your finances say about your relationship?","duration":3012,"files":[{"filesize":24096000,"mimetype":"audio/mpeg","urls":["http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-low/proto/http/vpid/p06b6s45.mp3"]}],"flattr":null,"guid":"urn:bbc:podcast:p06b6t88","language":null,"license":null,"link":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06b6t88","number":null,"released":1529208000,"short_title":null,"subtitle":"What does the way you handle your finances say about your relationship?","title":"What's Mine is Yours?"},{"author":"BBC World Service","content":"On 8th March, 2017 a fire engulfed part of the Virgen de la Asuncion children’s home on the outskirts of Guatemala City. 41 teenaged girls died.

The Therapod species, dating from the late Jurassic (155m years ago) is scientifically very interesting.

Leading climate scientists debate whether we will see fewer or more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. There is a mounting consensus, however, that we will see more intense hurricanes. So do we need to add a more severe Category 6 to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale.\n\n\n\nListening to Ice Melt \n\nIf you listen carefully to ice sheets in the Arctic, you can hear the glaciers calving and even the bubbles bursting as the ice melts.

But in this short, we find out that Beethoven might have made a last-ditch effort to keep his music from ever feeling familiar, to keep pushing his listeners to a kind of psychological limit.</p> <p>Jad starts out talking with <strong>Alan Pierson</strong>, Artistic Director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, about the fact that neither of them really like Beethoven's Fifth. It feels, they say, heavy and ponderous. But then Alan tells Jad a story: Late in life, Beethoven got his hands on a metronome, went back into his symphonies, and marked them with tempos that are shockingly fast -- so fast, in fact, that most conductors simply refuse to play them as marked. To investigate, we gather up a quartet of musicians to give us a feel for Beethoven's speedy beats, and we talk to composer and author <strong>Matthew Guerrieri</strong> about the way fast tempos push us and unsettle us. But is that really what Beethoven was going for? WQXR host <strong>Terrance McKnight</strong> says given his background and personality, Beethoven clearly didn't want his music to be easy and comfortable. So, as an homage to our new found vision of Ludwig van B., we ask Alan and his players to take the Fifth to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to our <a href=\"http://www.bphil.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Philharmonic </a>musicians: Deborah Buck and Suzy Perelman on violin, Arash Amini on cello, and Ah Ling Neu on viola.</p>\n<p>And check out <span class=\"book\"><a title=\"buy this book at Amazon\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307593282/radiolabbooks-20/\"><em>The First Four Notes</em></a></span>, Matthew Guerrieri's book on Beethoven's Fifth.</p>","duration":null,"files":[{"filesize":0,"mimetype":"audio/mpeg","urls":["https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/http://audio.wnyc.org/radiolab_podcast/radiolab_podcast13beethoven.mp3"]}],"flattr":null,"guid":"http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/feb/19/speedy-beet/","language":null,"license":null,"link":"http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/269783-speedy-beet/","number":null,"released":1361311200,"short_title":null,"subtitle":"There are few musical moments more well-worn than the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
